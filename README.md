# Splitwise-like Expense Sharing Application using Specmatic

A contract-first Expense Sharing Application inspired by Splitwise, built using FastAPI, OpenAPI 3.0, and Specmatic.

This project demonstrates how executable API contracts can eliminate integration uncertainty by serving as a single source of truth for developers, testers, and AI coding agents.

---

## Objective

In traditional software development, frontend and backend teams often make assumptions about API behavior, leading to integration issues discovered late in the development cycle.

This project uses Specmatic to:

* Define APIs as executable contracts
* Generate mock servers directly from OpenAPI specifications
* Validate backend implementations through contract testing
* Perform schema resiliency testing
* Reduce integration uncertainty
* Enable AI coding agents to build against a precise specification

---

## Tech Stack

* FastAPI
* Python
* OpenAPI 3.0
* Specmatic
* Docker
* GitHub Actions

---

## API Operations

### Groups

| Method | Endpoint          |

| GET    | /groups/{groupId} |

### Expenses

| Method | Endpoint  |
| ------ | --------- |
| POST   | /expenses |
| GET    | /expenses |

### Balances

| Method | Endpoint           |

## Contract-First Workflow

```text
OpenAPI Contract
        ↓
Specmatic Mock Server
        ↓
FastAPI Implementation
        ↓
Contract Testing
        ↓
Schema Resiliency Testing
        ↓
GitHub Actions CI Validation
        ↓
Verified Integration
```

The OpenAPI specification acts as the single source of truth throughout the development lifecycle.

---

## Running the Backend

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the FastAPI application:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Application URL:

```text
http://localhost:8000
```

Swagger Documentation:

```text
http://localhost:8000/docs
```

---

## Running Specmatic Mock Server

Generate a mock server directly from the OpenAPI contract:

```bash
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm \
-v $(pwd):/work \
-w /work \
specmatic/specmatic mock openapi/expense-sharing-api.yaml
```

Specmatic automatically creates mock endpoints based on the contract.

---

## Running Contract Tests

Start the FastAPI server and execute:

```bash
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm \
-v $(pwd):/work \
-w /work \
--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
specmatic/specmatic test \
--testBaseURL=http://host.docker.internal:8000 \
openapi/expense-sharing-api.yaml
```

Specmatic validates:

* Response status codes
* Response schema
* Required fields
* Data types
* Contract compliance

---

## Schema Resiliency Testing

Schema resiliency testing verifies that the API correctly handles invalid, missing, and mutated request data.

Examples include:

* Missing request body
* Missing required fields
* Invalid data types
* Invalid path parameters
* Unexpected values

This helps uncover edge cases and strengthens API reliability.

---

## Specmatic Configuration

The project uses Specmatic V3 configuration through:

```text
specmatic.yaml
```

Configuration includes:

* Contract test execution
* Schema resiliency testing
* Coverage reporting
* CI integration settings

---

## CI/CD Integration

Contract tests run automatically using GitHub Actions.

Workflow file:

```text
.github/workflows/specmatic.yml
```

The pipeline:

1. Sets up Python and Java
2. Installs backend dependencies
3. Starts the FastAPI server
4. Waits for server readiness
5. Executes Specmatic contract tests
6. Generates coverage reports
7. Fails builds on contract violations

This ensures API contracts remain validated on every push and pull request.

---

## Example API

### Create Group

Request:

```json
{
  "name": "Goa Trip"
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "groupId": 1,
  "name": "Goa Trip"
}
```

---

## Test Results

The implementation successfully passes:

* Positive contract scenarios
* Negative contract scenarios
* Schema resiliency tests
* API coverage checks

Result:

```text
35 Tests Executed
35 Passed
0 Failed
100% API Coverage
```

---

## Why Specmatic?

Specmatic transforms OpenAPI specifications into executable contracts.

Benefits include:

* Early integration testing
* Automated contract validation
* Mock generation
* Faster feedback cycles
* Reduced integration failures
* Improved AI-assisted development
* Continuous contract verification in CI/CD

---

## How This Helps AI Coding Agents

AI coding agents often generate code based on assumptions.

By providing an executable OpenAPI contract, AI agents receive:

* Precise endpoint definitions
* Request schemas
* Response schemas
* Validation rules
* Expected examples
* Executable test cases

This significantly reduces ambiguity and improves generated code quality.
